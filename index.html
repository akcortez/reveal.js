		### Project Overview
		<small>		

		- What is the project?
		
		The project I choose is an open source 2D/3D game development engine. It allows game development through many engines and is extremely popular. I am familiar with it because it was mentioned in the upcoming game jam Huskie Hackers may be participating in.
		- What does it do?

		It allows users to have an easy set of tools to develop games in an organized manner rather than using many different tools.
		- Who uses it?

		Those who want to develop small games or even just get into game development as a whole.

		### Non-Code Contribution Opportunities
		<small>	

		- What non-code areas are open (e.g., documentation, translation, design)?

		There are many documentation issues open. I personally was looking through documentation because it remains an important part of coding!
		- Link to open issue(s) or examples

		[Rewording Function Documentation](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/issues/7307)
		
		[AudioServer Documentation does not specify units of time](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/issues/7009)
		
		[Curve2D.get_closest_point() incorrectly documented](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/issues/5894)

		- Why are these contributions valuable?

		These remain extremely valuable because new contributors should be able to understand extactly what code is doing. When the documentation is wrong, it can lead to easily getting confused or struggling with what the contributors may want to add.

		### Contribution Guidelines

		<small>	

		- Where are the guidelines found?

		There are many documentation documents that allow for instructions on how to get started. One includes a [contribution](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document as well.
		- Is the onboarding process beginner-friendly?

		It is extremely beginner friendly. They provide countless resources for people to get start with non code contributions such as a [PR workflow](https://contributing.godotengine.org/en/latest/organization/pull_requests/creating_pull_requests.html) and [proposing new features](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#proposing-features-or-improvements).
		- Anything that surprised or confused you?

		The repo was extremely easy to go through. Nothing suprised me really. The need for continuous documentation updates was not surpising as that is a common issue among repos.

		### My Next Steps

		<small>	

		- What do you plan to do for your contribution?

		I plan to go through the past issues I presented and linked and try to see what documentation I can update.
		- What support/resources do you need?

		The issues provide urls to the documentation that needs updating and the issues are labeled according to it being documentation and beginner friendly, so finidng them is extremely easy. I may need to learn how to use Sphinx since it is common in the repo.
		- When will you start?

		I can honestly start as soon as possible, since documentation is something pretty simple to contribute to.
